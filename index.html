                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Niels Lindberg-Poulsen</strong>, I'm 26 years old and live in Copenhagen together with my Swedish girlfriend who is studying Business & IT.
                        <br>
                        <br> I enjoy going to concerts and do so quite regularly. I've always enjoyed PC gaming and I still spent several hours a week playing various games. Other than that I guess my interests are pretty broad, I like listening to audiobooks on history at the moment.
                        <br>
                        <br> This spring, I’m studying 6 distance courses; 4 bachelor level programming courses and one knowledge management course at LTU, along with one programming course at Örebro. I'm also doing a Front End Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.com at the same time.
                        <br>
                        <br> I have a bachelor’s degree in Economics from Copenhagen Business School. I've worked 6+ years in Nordea primarily as a programmer as well as a stakeholder on different IT projects.
                        <br>
                        <br> If you want to learn more about me you can also checkout my online resume at <a href="https://nielslindberg.github.io" target="_blank">nielslindberg.github.io</a></p>
                        <!-- a horizontal ruler splits the about me and about site sections -->
                        <hr>
                </section>
                <!-- the about site section holds information regarding this website and what the purpose is-->
                <section class="about-site">
                    <!-- the about site information is displayed through an h2 heading and a paragraph of information with breakpoints -->
                    <h2>About this website</h2>
                    <p>This website is a foodblog, where i'll post my take on different recipes i stumble upon. Currently I have only done dinner recipes, but if you have any suggestions for me to try out, then feel free to jump over to the contact page and write me an email!.
                        <br>
                        <br> This site is also the final assignment for the introductory webdevelopment course on LTU. The requirements for that course are to purely use HTML & CSS which is why the interactivity with the users are limited.

        <!-- fooder elements, even though it looks empty it does have an affect on the visual layout of the page. as im creating a border at the bottom,
        i guess its just a matter of taste but i like that there is line signaling end of contents.-->
